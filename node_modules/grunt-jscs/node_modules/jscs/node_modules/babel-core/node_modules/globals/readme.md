# globals [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/globals.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/globals)

> Global identifiers from different JavaScript environments

Extracted from [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/master/src/vars.js) and [ESLint](https://github.com/nzakas/eslint/blob/master/conf/environments.json) and merged.

It's just a [JSON file](globals.json), so use it in whatever environment you like.
